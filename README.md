# LeetCode_Contest_Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I upload coding solutions from LeetCode contests. These solutions are categorized by contest type and contest number, making it easy to navigate through the problems and their solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: `Weekly_Contests` and `Bi-Weekly_Contests`. Each of these directories contains subdirectories named after the contest numbers. Inside each subdirectory, you'll find:

- **Question Folders**: Named `first`, `second`, `third`, and `fourth` representing the question number in the contest.
  - `problem.txt`: A text file containing the link to the problem statement on LeetCode.
  - `solution.java`: The solution file containing the Java solution to the problem.
